# **Python-Programming-for-Beginners**
**This Repository will help you to understand Python in detail. And tells you More Information from the very Beginner level.**

## **Installation**
Use Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook to run this file.

Python is a commonly interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum from 1985 to 1990. Like Perl, the Python source code is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial is a good understanding of the Python programming language.  

## **Why Learn Python?**

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be easy to read. English keywords are often used, but other languages use punctuation and have less syntactic structure than other languages. 

 Python is essential for students and professionals to become good software developers. Especially when working in the field of web development. Here are some of the main benefits of learning Python.
 
-	Python is interpreted – Python is processed by the interpreter at run time. You do not need to compile the program before you can run it. This is similar to PERL or PHP. 

-	Python is interactive. In fact, you can sit at the Python prompt and interact directly with the interpreter to write your program. 

-	Python is object-oriented – Python supports object-oriented styles of programming techniques that encapsulate your code in objects. 

-	Python is a beginner's language-Python is a great language for novice programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications, from simple word processing to web browsers and games. 

## **The key features of Python**

-	Supports functional and structured programming methods and OOP. 

-	You can use it as a scripting language or compile it into bytecode to build large applications. 

-	Provides dynamic data types at a very high level and supports dynamic type checking. 

-	Supports automatic garbage collection. 

-	Easy integration with C, C ++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, Java.

## **Python application**

-	As mentioned earlier, Python is one of the most widely used languages on the web. Some of them are listed here. 

-	Easy to learn-Python has several keywords, a simple structure, and a well-defined syntax. This allows students to learn a language quickly. 

-	Easy to read-Python code is more clearly defined and visible. 

-	Easy to maintain-Python source code is fairly easy to maintain. 

-	Wide Standard Library-Most of the Python libraries is highly portable and cross-platform compatible with UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh. 

-	Interactive Mode-Python supports an interactive mode that allows you to interactively test and debug your code snippets.
